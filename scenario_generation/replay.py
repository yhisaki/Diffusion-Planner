"""Closed-loop replay of a saved :class:`scenario_generation.route.Route`.

High-level flow
---------------

1. Load the Route and rebuild a ``LaneletSceneBuilder`` from ``route.map_path``.
2. Build an initial ``SceneContext`` containing just the ego (no neighbors),
   placed at ``route.start_pose`` with its 31-step history synthesised
   backwards along the lanelet centerlines (see
   ``LaneletSceneBuilder.generate_history``).
3. Enter the closed-loop: each simulation tick we

   * Run batched inference on every currently-alive agent as ego (reusing
     :func:`scenario_generation.simulate._predict_batch` — a single forward
     pass with all agents concatenated along the batch dim, no sequential
     per-agent calls).
   * Advance every agent one physical step via
     :func:`scenario_generation.simulate.advance_scene`.
   * Periodically run the NPC spawn manager:

     - **Despawn** any neighbor farther than ``despawn_distance`` m from ego.
     - **Spawn** up to ``max_active_npcs`` (hard cap) neighbors near the ego
       with a small per-tick probability, using a realistic synthesised
       history and a route that is sometimes biased to overlap the ego's
       own route (see ``SpawnConfig.ego_overlap_ratio``).
   * Save an overview PNG per tick.

4. Terminate when the ego arrives within ``goal_tolerance_m`` of
   ``route.goal_pose`` or after ``n_steps`` ticks.

Traffic lights are managed by :class:`TrafficLightController`
(``scenario_generation.traffic_light``), which discovers TL regulatory
elements from the lanelet2 map, builds cycle groups, and writes the 5-dim
one-hot into ``scene.map_data.lanes[:, :, 8:13]`` every map refresh.

Batched inference note
----------------------

Each alive agent is a separate scene dict (different ego-centric coordinate
frames) but ``_predict_batch`` concatenates them along ``batch_dim=0`` for a
single ``model(data)`` call. This is the point the user emphasised: we never
loop inference sequentially; even spawned neighbors enter the same batch on
the very next tick.

The ``MapTensorCache`` is rebuilt whenever a new lanelet is added to
``scene.map_data`` during NPC spawning (there is no ``invalidate()`` method —
see CLAUDE.md and the cache definition in ``tensor_converter.py``).

@dataclass
class SpawnConfig:
    """Controls the NPC spawn/despawn manager.

    All distances in metres, all times in simulation steps (each step = 0.1 s).

    Attributes:
        spawn_period_steps: Run the spawn/despawn tick every N steps.
            ``10`` ≈ once per simulated second.
        max_active_npcs: Hard upper bound on the number of concurrent
            neighbors. Neighbor count is not kept constant — it drifts in
            ``[0, max_active_npcs]`` driven by ``spawn_probability`` and
            despawn distance.
        spawn_probability: Per-tick chance of attempting a spawn when the
            active count is below the cap.
        min_spawn_distance: A spawn candidate must sit at least this far
            from ego.
        max_spawn_distance: A spawn candidate must sit no further than this
            from ego.
        despawn_distance: Any neighbor farther than this from ego is dropped.
            Default 120 m matches the user's spec.
        forward_bias: Probability that a spawn candidate is restricted to
            lanelets in front of the ego (vs. free directional choice).
        min_npc_separation: Minimum centre-to-centre distance between a new
            spawn and any existing agent's OBB. Matches the upstream
            npc_manager constant.
        goal_tolerance_m: Ego-to-goal distance that triggers a
            "goal reached" termination.
        max_steps: Maximum simulation ticks before forced termination.
            6000 ticks = 600 s = 10 minutes of simulated time.
        seed: RNG seed used for spawn candidate selection, vehicle
            dimensions, speeds, route choices. ``None`` for non-deterministic.
        ego_overlap_ratio: Fraction of spawned NPCs that are routed to
            overlap with the ego's route_lanelet_ids. Per user: 0.30 (30%
            overlap, 70% random forward routes).
        npc_min_speed: Floor for a spawned NPC's initial speed (m/s).
        npc_max_speed: Ceiling for a spawned NPC's initial speed (m/s).
        npc_route_length_m: Minimum arc-length fed to ``find_route`` for each
            new NPC — drives how many lanelets of route_lanes it gets.
        curvature_threshold: Max allowable |Δheading| between consecutive
            centerline segments for a lanelet to be spawnable. Matches the
            default used by ``is_lanelet_straight``.
        map_refresh_steps: Rebuild ``scene.map_data`` with the closest
            lanelets to the ego every this many steps. Matches the training
            distribution where the ``(140, 20, 33)`` lane tensor is packed
            with the closest lanelets to ego — not a fixed pre-baked subset.
        max_map_lanelets: Upper bound on the number of lanelets packed into
            ``map_data.lanes``. Must match / not exceed
            ``tensor_converter._NUM_LANES`` (currently 140).
        map_mask_range_m: Half-side of the AABB lane-filter around ego.
            Matches the Diffusion-Planner ROS node's ``judge_inside``
            (``mask_range = 100.0``). A lanelet passes the filter when its
            center, first, or last centerline point is within this square.
