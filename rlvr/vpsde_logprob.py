"""VPSDE denoising step with Gaussian log-probability computation.

Adapts the DDV2 DDIMScheduler_with_logprob approach to our VPSDE_linear noise schedule.
The key idea: at each reverse step, the model predicts x_0, and we compute the
Gaussian transition distribution p(x_{t_prev} | x_0) = N(mean, std) using
VPSDE marginal_prob. The log-probability of the actual sample under this
distribution provides the policy gradient signal for GRPO.

    Given a model's x_0 prediction and a target time t_prev, computes the
    marginal distribution p(x_{t_prev} | x_0) = N(mean_coeff * x_0, std)
    and either samples from it or evaluates the log-probability of a given sample.

    Args:
        x0_pred: Model's clean trajectory prediction. Shape: arbitrary, but
            typically (B, P, T, D) for the future timesteps (no current state).
        t_prev: Target diffusion time for the reverse step. Shape: broadcastable
            to x0_pred (e.g., (B, 1, 1, 1) or scalar tensor).
        sde: VPSDE_linear instance.
        min_std: Minimum standard deviation to prevent log-prob explosion near t=0.

        prev_sample: If provided, compute log-prob for this fixed sample instead
            of drawing a new one. Used in the optimization pass (Stage 2).
